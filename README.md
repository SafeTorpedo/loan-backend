after entering user and password... You will be directed to index.html in which you will login or register as an admin or a user. (Currently if your email ends with @admin.com you will be logged in as an admin and if your email ends with a @user.com then you will login as a user)

the admin page is index1.html
the user page is index2.html

In the user page we have to display the loans which that user has taken, the due date for them, type of loans, total amount he has to pay back and the credit score he currently has.
